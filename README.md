# Infinite Sketch
Simply an app for viewing images in a set amount of time, along with many features to help artists practice their drawing skills

## Windows
Download the latest [Infinite Sketch installer](https://github.com/musaad0/Infinite-Sketch/releases/tag/v1.1.1).`Infinite-Sketch-Setup-1.1.1`

Infinite Sketch will automatically update when a new release is available.

Note: you will get warnings when you download the app, that's because I did not pay for a code signing certificate so you can ignore them.

## Development
```
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the app
npm run dist

```
